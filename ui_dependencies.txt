## MISSING UI LIBRARIES

No external component library used:
  ❌ Material-UI (MUI)

  ❌ Bootstrap
  ❌ Styled Components
  ❌ Emotion

All UI components are custom-built with plain CSS.


## UI-RELATED PACKAGE CATEGORIES

FRAMEWORK:
  - react
  - react-dom
  - react-router-dom

VISUALIZATION:
  - lightweight-charts

ANIMATION:
  - framer-motion

UTILITIES:
  - html2canvas
  - axios

BACKEND:
  - @supabase/supabase-js

LINTING:
  - eslint
  - eslint-plugin-react-hooks
  - eslint-plugin-react-refresh


## RECOMMENDATIONS

CONSIDER ADDING:

1. CSS Framework:
   - Tailwind CSS - for utility-first styling
   - OR CSS Modules - for scoped styles

2. Component Library (Optional):
   - Radix UI - for accessible primitives
   - Headless UI - for unstyled components

3. Icon Library:
   - Currently using emoji icons
   - Consider: react-icons or lucide-react

4. Form Management:
   - react-hook-form - for complex forms
   - zod - for validation

5. Date Management:
   - date-fns - lightweight date utilities
   - Currently using native Date objects

6. State Management (if needed):
   - zustand - lightweight state management
   - Only if Context API becomes insufficient

7. Testing:
   - @testing-library/react
   - vitest
   - Currently no tests


## BUNDLE OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

1. Code Splitting:
   - Implement React.lazy() for route-based splitting
   - Lazy load heavy components (charts, modals)

2. Tree Shaking:
   - Ensure imports are optimized
   - Use named imports instead of default imports

3. Lazy Loading:
   - Load framer-motion only when animations needed
   - Load html2canvas only when export feature used

4. CDN:
   - Consider loading heavy libraries from CDN
   - Especially for chart library

5. Image Optimization:
   - Optimize pattern icons (currently emoji)
   - Use WebP format for images


## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

1. Dependency Audit:
   - Run: npm audit
   - Check for known vulnerabilities

2. Updates:
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Especially: react, supabase, axios

3. Bundle Analysis:
   - Use: vite-plugin-bundle-visualizer
   - Identify large dependencies
